# Error Resolution and Changes

The original error was a TypeScript type error in `src/module/student/student.route.ts`.

## Error

```
Error : 'No overload matches this call.
  The last overload gave the following error.
    Argument of type '(req: Request, res: Response) => Promise<Response<any, Record<string, any>>>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Application<Record<string, any>>'.
      Type '(req: Request<ParamsDictionary, any, any, ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>, res: Response<any, Record<string, any>>) => Promise<...>' is missing the following properties from type 'Application<Record<string, any>>': init, defaultConfiguration, engine, set, and 63 more.ts(2769)
index.d.ts(168, 5): The last overload is declared here.'

Error Path: src\module\student\student.route.ts
```

## Cause of the Error

The error was caused by a type incompatibility issue with the beta version of Express.js (`v5`) that was being used in the project. The type definitions for Express v5 are not yet stable and can cause misleading type errors like the one encountered.

## Resolution

To resolve the error, I performed the following steps:

1.  **Uninstalled the existing Express packages:**
    ```bash
    npm uninstall express @types/express
    ```

2.  **Installed a stable version of Express and its type definitions:**
    ```bash
    npm install express@4 @types/express
    ```

By downgrading to a stable version of Express (`v4`), the type incompatibility issue was resolved, and the error no longer occurs.
